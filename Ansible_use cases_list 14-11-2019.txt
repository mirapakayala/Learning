#Ansible
Ansible is used for managing IT infrastructure and deploy software apps to remote nodes.
For example, Ansible allows you to deploy as an application to many nodes with one single command.
Use Case: To copy files from controller to target systems, used copy module
Use Case:
Imagine you have a number of hosts in your environment that you would like to restart in a particular order.
Some of them are web servers and others are database servers. So you would like to power down the Web servers first followed by the database servers then power up
the database servers and then the Web servers.
Ex run cmd 1 on server 1, cmd 2 on server 2, restart server 1, restart server 2
Use Case:
With ansible, you could provision hundreds of VMs on public clouds like Amazon and provision private cloud in private cloud set
up like VM Ware based infrastructure and move onto configuring applications on those systems and set up communications between them.
There are a lot of built in modules available in Ansible that supports these kind of operations.
Use Case: Playbook to add entry in a file, use lineinfile module of file category
