Code Coverage:
Lets say you have 1000 line of code out of which 900 lines are covered by unit tests then your code coverage is 90%.
Typically 85 to 90 % is good amout of code coverage.
Sonarqube is one of the tool which helps in measuring code coverage.

Why is it important?
Unit testing is one of the most important thing in modern development.
Good unit tests are there forever, they catch defects in future.
System with good unit test improve over a time. Developer do not worry about breaking functionality, they continuously refactor.

Code coverage is one of the measure of having great unit test.

code coverage is just a result of unit test. Having great unit tests would result in great coverage.

How to measure unit tests?
Using Sonar.
