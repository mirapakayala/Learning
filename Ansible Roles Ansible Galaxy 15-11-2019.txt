ERROR! Failed to get data from the API server (https://galaxy.ansible.com/api/):
 Failed to validate the SSL certificate for galaxy.ansible.com:443. Make sure your managed systems have a valid CA certificate installed.
 If the website serving the url uses SNI you need python >= 2.7.9 on your managed machine  (the python executable used (/usr/bin/python2.6)
 is version: 2.6.9 (unknown, Nov  2 2017, 19:21:21) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-11)])
 or you can install the `urllib3`, `pyOpenSSL`, `ndg-httpsclient`, and `pyasn1` python modules 
to perform SNI verification in python >= 2.6. You can use validate_certs=False if you do not need to confirm the servers identity 
but this is unsafe and not recommended. Paths checked for this platform: /etc/ssl/certs, /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem,
 /etc/pki/tls/certs, /usr/share/ca-certificates/cacert.org, /etc/ansible. 
The exception msg was: [Errno 1] _ssl.c:493: error:14077410:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:sslv3 alert handshake failure.
