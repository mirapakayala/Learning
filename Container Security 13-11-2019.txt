Container Security:

Security Risks and challenges of using containers

Docker: It does not solve any application security problems
	But it can create system and network attack surfaces
Threats to My Container?
Model 1:
1st Vector: Application escape
2nd : Host
Model 2:
1st Vector: Application escape
2nd : Network
	Host
	Container
	NFS,LDAP
Model5:
1st Vector: Application escape
2nd : Network
	Orchestration
OWASP Docker Top 10:
1. Insecure user mapping:
	Running code as previledged user
2. Patch Management:
	Hosts
	Container orchestration
	Images
3. Network Seperation/Firewalling:
Basic DMZ technique
	Internal
	External
Deny all
allow only what is needed

4.Security Contexts:
Do not mix front/backend services-Running backend and frontend from the same container
- No mix prod/ Dev
6. Resource protection:
Resource limit
7.Image integrity and origin
-Basic trust issue: Running arbitrary code from somewhere
-Docker content trust
8. Follow immutable paradigm:
-least privilege
-limits: Containers really need to write upload of files,R/W hosts mount
10. Logging:
Tear down container: log lost
-remote logging container, orchestration, hosts

How container technolgy can be secured/Scanning docker containers to manage security risks?
-Scanning docker container to get visibility on open source security vulnerability
BlackDuckHubscanner:
docker pull blackducksoftware/hub_scanner


Example of integrating with jenkins:
Hub detect Jenkins plugin
